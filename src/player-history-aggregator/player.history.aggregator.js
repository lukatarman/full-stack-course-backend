   * - we want to decouple the player history in the game class from the knowledge that we have performed a check on steamcharts and
   *   found(or not) a player history
   * - the game class should keep information about the game and not information about where it got its data from - the latter is a seperate
   *   concern
   * - keeping the check on the game class brings no additional value to if from the standpoint of the user, it is only usefull for the
   *   application so it can perform the player history collection operatons correctly
   * - for every game, we store in a seperate collection if we checked the player history in a specific source(steamcharts in that case) and
   *   if we found something
   * - for this we use the HistoryCheck class
   * - we record the steamcharts history checks after we got all the steamcharts details pages
   * - we persist the checks in a separate collection as mentioned above and use it later in XXXaddCurrentPlayers
